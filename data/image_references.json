      "reference": "The bar chart illustrates quarterly sales performance across four quarters. The vertical axis represents sales revenue in thousands of dollars, while the horizontal axis shows the time periods from Q1 to Q4. The data reveals a consistent upward trend, with Q1 starting at approximately 45,000 dollars, followed by steady growth through Q2 and Q3, reaching 65,000 and 78,000 respectively. The final quarter, Q4, shows the highest performance at around 92,000 dollars, representing more than double the initial quarter's revenue.",

      "reference": "The line graph depicts temperature variations throughout a typical day. The horizontal axis represents time from midnight to midnight in 3-hour intervals, while the vertical axis shows temperature in degrees Celsius. The temperature starts at around 12 degrees at midnight, drops to its lowest point of 8 degrees at 6 AM, then rises steadily throughout the morning and afternoon. The peak temperature of 28 degrees occurs at 3 PM, after which it gradually declines through the evening, returning to approximately 14 degrees by midnight.",
