I will generate the exact Python code block for you to copy and paste into Google Colab.

The code will:
1.  Install MFA and dependencies on Colab.
2.  Organize your uploaded files into the correct folder structure.
3.  Run the alignment and zip the results for download.

I am ready to output this code immediately upon confirmation.
