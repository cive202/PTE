# Deployment Suggestions for a New System

To run the PTE Practice system on a new machine, you have three main paths depending on your technical preference:

## **Suggestion 1: Docker Compose (Highly Recommended)**
This is the most "portable" way. You wrap the entire system (Flask, ASR, and MFA) into a single configuration.
- **Pros**: One command to start everything (`docker-compose up`); no need to install Python or dependencies on the new system.
- **Requirements**: Only Docker installed on the new machine.
- **Steps**: I will create a `docker-compose.yml` for you. You copy the `PTE` folder to the new system and run it.

## **Suggestion 2: Manual Setup (Development Mode)**
You mirror the setup you have now.
- **Pros**: Easiest for making further code changes.
- **Requirements**: Python 3.10, Docker, and FFmpeg installed.
- **Steps**: 
    1. Copy the `PTE` folder.
    2. Create a new `venv` and `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    3. Manually build/run the ASR Docker container.
    4. Start the Flask app.

## **Suggestion 3: Docker Registry (The "Cloud" Way)**
If you want to "pull" the system like a professional app.
- **Pros**: Don't need to rebuild images on the new machine.
- **Requirements**: A Docker Hub account.
- **Steps**:
    1. Push your `pte-asr-grammar` image to Docker Hub.
    2. On the new system, use a script to pull the image and mount the local `PTE_MFA_TESTER_DOCKER` data folder.
