## Exclude venv and transient data from Git
The `venv/` directory is currently being tracked by Git, which is causing unnecessary files to be staged. I will update the `.gitignore` and untrack the existing files.

### **Steps:**
1.  **Update .gitignore**:
    - Add `venv/` to exclude the virtual environment.
    - Add `PTE_MFA_TESTER_DOCKER/data/output_*/` and `PTE_MFA_TESTER_DOCKER/data/run_*/` to exclude transient MFA alignment results.
    - Add `corpus/check_*`, `corpus/recording_*`, and `corpus/temp_upload_*` to exclude user-uploaded recordings and temp files.
2.  **Untrack files from Git index**:
    - Run `git rm -r --cached venv/` to remove the virtual environment from the index without deleting it from your disk.
    - Run `git rm -r --cached PTE_MFA_TESTER_DOCKER/data/output_*` to remove temporary MFA outputs.
3.  **Verify**:
    - Run `git status` to ensure `venv/` is no longer staged.

Do you want me to proceed with these changes?
